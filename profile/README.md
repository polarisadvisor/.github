## [The Polaris Advisor Program](https://polaris-advisor.com)
  
  We help software product companies create bespoke measurement systems to maximize the customer value their teams deliver.

Our research-driven advisory service enables organizations to implement programs that improve collaboration and decision-making across teams, middle management, and executives.

We help you build tailored measurement systems that:

- Connect team efforts to customer value streams.
- Optimize delivery flow to reduce time-to-value.
- Foster a sustainable, data-informed culture aligned with customer and company goals.

With Polaris,our suite of modeling and measurement  tools built on the open source  Apache DevLake platform, we help you visualize, model, and manage your system — without software subscription fees. 

Your business deserves a measurement framework that reflects the unique dynamics of your customers, teams, and purpose.

We help you design and manage it—as a service. 

Batteries included.


## Open source extensions to Apache Devlake

We believe Apache Devlake is a foundational piece of infrastructure for building open and trusted measurement systems that can be easily adopted by engineerings teams interested in reasoning about their work in a data informed manner. 

As such, we are committed to contributing to this ecosystem with components that have been proven in the field for many years. 

While Devlake has a awesome infrastructure layer, at this point there is much that can be done to add to the catalog of out-of-the-box dashboards for various use cases. 

Here are some components that we have used in our program that we feel will be more broadly useful to the Devlake commmunity.
