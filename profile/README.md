  We help software product companies create bespoke measurement systems to maximize the customer value their teams deliver.

Our research-driven advisory service enables organizations to implement programs that improve collaboration and decision-making across teams, middle management, and executives.

We help you build tailored measurement systems that:

- Connect team efforts to customer value streams.
- Optimize delivery flow to reduce time-to-value.
- Foster a sustainable, data-informed culture aligned with customer and company goals.

Polaris,our suite of modeling and measurement  tools built on the open source  [Apache DevLake](https://devlake.apache.org) platform, helps you visualize, model, and manage your system — without software subscription fees. 

Your business deserves a measurement framework that reflects the unique dynamics of your customers, teams, and purpose.

We help you design and manage it—as a service. 

Batteries included.


## Open source extensions to Apache Devlake

We believe Apache Devlake is a foundational piece of infrastructure for building open and trusted measurement systems that can be easily adopted bottom-up by engineering teams interested in reasoning about their work in a data informed manner. 

As such, we are committed to contributing to this ecosystem with components that have been proven in the field for many years. 

Versions of these components were originally developed for our proprietary measurement platform [Polaris](https://www.exathink.com/take-the-tour), but we've made the decision to port as much of the functionality as we can, to run as open source components on Apache Devlake to make it more widely accessible. 

While Devlake has an awesome infrastructure layer, at this point there is much that can be done to add to the catalog of out-of-the-box dashboards for various use cases. 

To begin with, we've released dashboards for the flow of work, flow of code etc below.
