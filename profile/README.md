## [The Polaris Advisor Program](https://polaris-advisor.com)
  
  We help software product companies create bespoke measurement systems to maximize the customer value their teams deliver.

Our research-driven advisory service enables organizations to implement programs that improve collaboration and decision-making across teams, middle management, and executives.

We help you build tailored measurement systems that:

- Connect team efforts to customer value streams.
- Optimize delivery flow to reduce time-to-value.
- Foster a sustainable, data-informed culture aligned with customer and company goals.

Polaris, our suite of modeling and measurement  tools built on the open source  [Apache DevLake](https://devlake.apache.org) platform, helps you visualize, model, and manage your system — without software subscription fees. 

Your business deserves a measurement framework that reflects the unique dynamics of your customers, teams, and purpose.

We help you design and manage it—as a service. 

Batteries included.


## Open source extensions to Apache Devlake

We believe Apache Devlake is a foundational piece of infrastructure for building open and trusted measurement systems based on telemetry from standard software development workflow tools.

There are many sophisticated commercial tools in this space, but the key benfit of Apache Devlake is that it combines a very powerful and extensible system instrumentation architecture, with a completely customizable analytics tier. 

In principle, it can be easily adopted bottom-up by engineering teams interested in reasoning about their work in a data informed manner without too much concern about costs and licensing fees etc. As such it is an ideal tool for self-directed teams who are interested in analyzing and inspecting their work to find out ways to improve. 

As such, we are committed to contributing to this ecosystem with components that have been proven in the field for many years. 

While Devlake has an awesome infrastructure layer, at this point there is much that can be done to add to the catalog of out-of-the-box dashboards for various use cases, and we hope to help here. 

As our contribution, we are porting several key components that were originally developed for our proprietary measurement platform [Polaris](https://www.exathink.com/take-the-tour), to run as open source components on Apache Devlake to make it more widely accessible as open source dashboards and plugins on Apache Devlake.
