A consulting service offered under the Presence Calculus family of software products.

We help software product companies create bespoke measurement systems to maximize the customer value their teams deliver.

Our research-driven advisory service enables organizations to implement programs that improve collaboration and decision-making across teams, middle management, and executives.

We help you build tailored measurement systems that:

- Connect team efforts to customer value streams.
- Optimize delivery flow to reduce time-to-value.
- Foster a sustainable, data-informed culture aligned with customer and company goals.

Polaris, our suite of light-weight modeling and measurement tools, helps you visualize, model, and manage your system — without software subscription fees. 

These proprietary tools are built on the foundation of the open-source tools developed in our long-running research program [The Presence Calculus Project](https://github.com/presence-calculus).

We make the underlying knowledge required to build measurement systems freely available in our substack [The Polaris Flow Dispatch](https://www.polaris-flow-dispatch.com), so you can get a flavor of what it means
to work with us before deciding if we are the right fit for you. 

### Building production systems

For building production-grade operational measurement systems, we leverage the open source  [Apache DevLake](https://devlake.apache.org) platform for instrumentation, as well as other third-party data integration platforms such as [Merge.dev](https://www.merge.dev/) where appropriate. We can also work with existing engineering management platforms in many cases, if they instrument the appropriate operational signals. 

Your business deserves a context-aware measurement framework that reflects the unique dynamics of your customers, teams, and purpose with clear and transparent guidance on the underlying theories of measurement. 

We help you design and manage it.
